# Opioid-App
Opioid Dashboard for NSS Cohort 2 

This Shiny App allows the user to look at deaths resulting from opioid overdoses from 2006 to 2016 on a choropleth map by dragging a slider bar to change the year. Once the user chooses a year, they can hover over a state on to see the exact death rate for that year.
